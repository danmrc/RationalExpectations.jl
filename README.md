# RationalExpectations.jl

Routines to solve Rational Expectation models in Julia.

This is under development. Pretty much following the excellent _Economic Dynamics in Discrete Time_ by Jianjun Miao.

So far, I have implemented Klein(2000) and partially implemented Sims(2000) (aka gensys). All is written in pure Julia. Plans include non Linear solver and the AIM (or Anderson Moore) algorithms.

A further documentation will soon be avialable.
